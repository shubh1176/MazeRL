# Adaptive Maze Training Environment (AMTE)

A reinforcement learning environment for training and analyzing maze-solving agents.

## Features
- Real-time visualization of agent learning
- Interactive parameter tuning
- Multiple training modes
- Performance analytics

A visual reinforcement learning platform that helps AI agents learn to solve mazes. Think of it as a sandbox where AI learns through trial and error, and you can watch it happen in real-time!
- ðŸ‘€ Watch the AI learn in real-time with a visual interface
- ðŸŽ® Change settings on the fly to see how it affects learning
- ðŸ“Š See how well the AI is doing with live performance graphs
- ðŸŽ¯ Multiple training approaches to solve different types of mazes

## How It Works
1. **The Maze**: We create a maze with walls, a starting point, and a goal
2. **The AI Agent**: Our AI starts with no knowledge of how to solve mazes
3. **Learning Process**: 
   - The AI explores the maze
   - Gets rewards for finding the goal
   - Learns from its mistakes and successes
   - Gradually gets better at finding the shortest path
   

It is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for deployment.
